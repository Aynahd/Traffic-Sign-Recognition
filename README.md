# Traffic Sign Recognition

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset. The model is trained using PyTorch. Data augmentations like rotation and blur were used to simulate real-world conditions.

The goal is to support safe autonomous driving systems.
